# About

I study the curious gap between what we claim to know and what we actually know. As a methodologist and advocate for scientific rigor, I've spent my career examining how evidence is constructed, interpreted, and applied—often finding that our most cherished research practices contain hidden fragilities. What fascinates me isn't just the production of knowledge but the messier question of how that knowledge translates into real improvements in human welfare. Whether scrutinizing thousands of meta-analyses to reveal how researcher choices shape conclusions, developing more sensitive measures of patient experiences, or creating practical tools for clinical decision-making, my work is driven by a simple conviction: that intellectual clarity serves human good. This pursuit isn't merely academic—it's about ensuring that when we claim our interventions help people, they actually do.

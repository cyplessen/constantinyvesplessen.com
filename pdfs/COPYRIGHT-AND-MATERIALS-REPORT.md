# Copyright & Materials Report for Publications

Generated: October 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Good news!** You can legally host most of your PDFs on your personal website. Here's what I found:

### ✅ Safe to Host (Author Accepted Manuscripts):
- **Elsevier journals** (JAD, etc.): Immediate posting allowed on personal website with CC-BY-NC-ND license
- **BMJ journals** (BMJ Open, BMJ Mental Health): Full green OA rights, can post published version with attribution
- **Springer journals** (Quality of Life Research): After 12-month embargo for accepted manuscript
- **Wolters Kluwer/LWW** (CORR): 6-12 month embargo for Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM)

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
1. **Version matters**: "Author Accepted Manuscript" (post-peer-review, pre-typesetting) is usually OK
2. **Published PDF**: Check if you have this vs. AAM version
3. **Attribution required**: Link back to published version
4. **PhD Thesis**: 100% yours to post! ✅

## File Naming Recommendations

Your current PDFs use citation format (e.g., "Plessen et al. - 2024 - Digital mental health...").

**Suggested renaming for website:**
- `plessen-2025-dif-promis-physical-function.pdf`
- `plessen-2024-digital-interventions-depression.pdf`
- `plessen-2023-psychotherapy-multiverse.pdf`
- `plessen-2023-promis-reference-values.pdf`
- `plessen-2022-multiverse-protocol.pdf`
- `plessen-2020-humor-personality.pdf`
- `plessen-2016-austrian-psychotherapy.pdf`
- `plessen-phd-thesis.pdf` ✅

**Reason**: Easier to link, cleaner URLs, better for SEO

<h1>Why Multiverse Meta-Analysis?</h1>
<p>When conducting a meta-analysis, researchers face dozens of decisions: Which studies to include? How to handle outliers? Which statistical model to use? Each choice seems reasonable, but different choices can lead to different conclusions.</p>
<p>Rather than making one set of arbitrary decisions, <strong>multiverse meta-analysis</strong> systematically explores how different reasonable analytical choices affect your conclusions. This approach transforms researcher degrees of freedom from a source of concern into a tool for understanding robustness.</p>
<p>This tutorial walks you through running your first multiverse meta-analysis using real data from the Metapsy database.</p>
<section id="what-youll-need" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-youll-need">What You’ll Need</h2>
<p>Basic R knowledge is helpful, but I’ll explain each step. You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>R (version 4.0 or higher)</li>
<li>RStudio (recommended but not required)</li>
<li>About 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="pics/logo.svg" align="right" height="139" alt="metaMultiverse hex logo"></p>
<p>First, we need to install <code>metaMultiverse</code> for running the multiverse analysis. We’ll get the data directly from the Metapsy API (no package installation needed for that!).</p>

<p>Not all analytical decisions are created equal. The framework distinguishes three types:</p>
<p><strong>Type E (Equivalent)</strong>: Options are theoretically interchangeable for your research question.<br>
- <em>Example</em>: Age groups (adults vs.&nbsp;mixed) when studying a universal phenomenon<br>
- <em>In multiverse</em>: Creates variations within a single multiverse<br>
- <em>Interpretation</em>: All options are included; adds “total” option combining all levels</p>
<p><strong>Type U (Uncertain)</strong>: Unclear which option is methodologically “correct.”<br>
- <em>Example</em>: Risk of bias thresholds—exclude only high-risk studies, or also “some concerns”?<br>
- <em>In multiverse</em>: Creates variations within a single multiverse<br>
- <em>Interpretation</em>: Exploring sensitivity to debated methodological choices</p>
<p><strong>Type N (Non-equivalent)</strong>: Options address fundamentally different research questions.<br>
- <em>Example</em>: Post-treatment vs.&nbsp;follow-up outcomes represent different constructs<br>
- <em>In multiverse</em>: Creates <strong>separate multiverses</strong> analyzed independently<br>
- <em>Interpretation</em>: These shouldn’t be combined; report separately</p>

<p>This plot shows: - <strong>Top panel</strong>: Effect size for each analysis (sorted by magnitude) - <strong>Bottom panels</strong>: Which analytical choices were used for each analysis</p>
<p>You can immediately see: - How much do results vary?<br>
- Are some choices driving the results?<br>
- Is the effect robust across specifications?</p>
<p>Another useful visualization is the <strong>Vibration of Effects (VoE)</strong> plot:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-2-type-n-decisions---separate-multiverses-by-study-quality">Example 2: Type N Decisions - Separate Multiverses by Study Quality</h3>
<p>In this example, we’ll use Type N decisions to create <strong>separate multiverses</strong> based on study quality. This is appropriate when different quality standards represent fundamentally different research questions.</p>
<p><strong>Research question</strong>: How does the effectiveness of digital interventions vary when we apply different study quality criteria?</p>
<p>Since these represent different questions about evidence quality (not just sensitivity analyses), we use <code>decision = "N"</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creates <strong>3 separate multiverses</strong> (one per quality threshold)<br>
</li>
<li>No “total_” option added (they shouldn’t be combined)<br>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-8-interpret-your-results">Step 8: Interpret Your Results</h2>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>How much do results vary?</strong> If all analyses point in the same direction with similar magnitudes, your conclusion is robust. If effect sizes range from positive to negative, your conclusion depends heavily on analytical choices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Which choices matter most?</strong> Look at the bottom panels of the specification curve. Do certain inclusion criteria consistently produce larger or smaller effects?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical significance</strong>: Do most analyses show significant effects, or does significance depend on which models you choose?</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="what-this-tells-us" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-tells-us">What This Tells Us</h2>
<p>Multiverse meta-analysis doesn’t give you “the answer”—it gives you transparency about how confident you should be in your answer. If your conclusion holds across most reasonable analytical choices, you can be more confident. If it’s sensitive to specific decisions, that’s important to report.</p>
<p>This approach moves us from “the effect size is X” to “across plausible specifications, effect sizes range from Y to Z, with most falling around X.”</p>

<p>This tutorial covered the practical workflow for multiverse meta-analysis. The <code>metaMultiverse</code> package can do much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include bias-adjustment methods (PET-PEESE, selection models)</li>
<li>Explore moderator effects across specifications</li>
<li>Export results for custom visualizations</li>
<li>Use the interactive Shiny app for exploration</li>
<li>Advanced custom factor groupings</li>
<li>Bayesian meta-analytic methods</li>

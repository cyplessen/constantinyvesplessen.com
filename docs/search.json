    "text": "2022\n\nDGPPN 2022\nThe robustness of the efficacy of digital interventions for anxiety: an umbrella review and multiverse meta-analysis November 23, 2022\nBackground: Over the last decade, several meta-analyses and meta-reviews synthesized the evidence on the efficacy of digital mental health interventions for anxiety disorders‚Äîunfortunately with diverging conclusions. This leaves clinicians, researchers, and funding agencies with inconsistent recommendations.\nMethods: To provide a birds-eye-perspective of the entire field we conducted an umbrella review and a multiverse meta-analysis. We investigated whether the meta-analytical method or the inclusion criteria were responsible for these differences, or whether most potential meta-analyses would reach similar conclusions.\nResults: Our umbrella review included six meta-analyses with 84 primary studies. The included meta-analyses differed substantially in their AMSTAR-2 ratings, indicating heterogeneous quality. Our multiverse meta-analysis produced 1193 meta-analyses resulting from all possible analytical decisions. We identified several analytical decisions that consistently led to inflated effect size estimates. Larger effect sizes were found for the comparisons with wait-list control groups than for the comparisons with active control groups (mean Hedges g = 0.58 95% CI [0.40, 0.76] vs g = 0.26 95% CI [0.20, 0.42]). Larger effect sizes were found for digital interventions combining smartphone with internet interventions compared to standalone smartphone or internet applications. Meta-analyses that focused exclusively on guided interventions produced twice the effect sizes than meta-analyses on unguided interventions (g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90] vs g = 0.30, 95% CI [0.13, 0.47]).\nConclusion: We identified several analytical decisions that consistently led to inflated effect size estimates. However, we also found that most decisions did not disproportionately influence the resulting summary effect size estimates, which suggests that meta-analytical findings on digital interventions for anxiety are robust.\n Conference Program\n\n\n\nEACLIPT 2022\nUsing multiverse meta-analyses to investigate the robustness of mental health research on psychological treatments for depression and digital interventions for anxiety November 12, 2022\nBackground: At several stages in any meta-analysis, researchers must decide between multiple equally defensible choices (e.g., different study inclusion criteria, different ways of dealing with low-quality studies, different choices of methods, etc.). These different analytical decisions frequently result in various meta-analyses with overlapping research questions reaching different conclusions‚Äîresulting in ambiguous recommendations for clinicians, researchers, and funding agencies.\nMethods: In a multiverse meta-analysis, researchers identify all these possible stages for analytical decisions, determine alternative analysis steps at each stage, and implement them simultaneously. As a result, a multiverse meta-analysis reports the outcomes of all possible meta-analyses resulting from all of these possible combinations. Therefore, this method is a promising tool to help answer why some of these meta-analyses diverged, whether the meta-analytical method and exclusion criteria were decisive for these differences, or whether we would reach similar results with most analytical strategies.\nResults: We present the preliminary results of multiverse meta-analyses to evaluate the influence different analytical decisions might have had on two research questions, namely 1) the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression and 2) the efficacy of digital interventions for anxiety disorders.\nConclusion: We could identify several analytical decisions that consistently lead to inflated effect size estimates (e.g., the comparison with wait-list control groups, the inclusion of high risk of bias studies, and sometimes ignoring effect size dependency). However, we also identified many decisions that did not disproportionately influence the resulting summary effect size estimates, suggesting the overall robustness of meta-analytical findings on psychological treatments for depression and digital mental health research for anxiety.\n Conference Program\n\n\n\nSIPS 2022\nWorkshop: Multiverse Analyses - Introduction and Applications June 23, 2022\nThis session will tackle the multiverse approach to psychological science and data analysis: In each research project, researchers need to make a multitude of decisions, including decisions about which measurements to choose, how to pre-process data, or which analysis to run. Each of these decisions is potentially impactful and may create a unique universe out of a multiverse of possible outcomes. After a general introduction to the concept of a multiverse, we will host several guest speakers highlighting different facets and implementations of multiverse analysis. Two talks will hereby discuss fundamentals of multiverse analysis, focusing on visualization (Matthew Kay) and available software. Four talks will discuss various implementations of multiverse analysis: Jessica Dafflon will discuss multiverse analysis in developmental neuroscience, Constantin Yves Plessen will talk about multiverse meta-analyses and Justin Landy will talk about his project on crowdsourcing hypothesis tests (fourth speaker is tbd).\n Workshop Program\n\n\n\nESMR 2022\nWhat if‚Ä¶? A very short primer on conducting multiverse meta-analyses in R April 23, 2022\nEven though conventional meta-analyses provide an overview of the published literature on a given research question, they do not consider different paths that could have been taken in selecting or analyzing the data. Most importantly, multiple meta-analyses with overlapping research questions can reach different conclusions due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, or data analytical decisions. It is therefore crucial to evaluate the influence such choices might have on the result of each meta-analysis. Was the meta-analytical method and exclusion criteria decisive, or is the same result reached via multiple analytical strategies? What if a meta-analysts would have decided to go a different path‚Äîwould the same outcome occur? Ensuring that the conclusions of a meta-analysis are not disproportionately influenced by data analytical decisions, a multiverse meta-analysis can provide the entire picture and underpin the robustness of the findings‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîby conducting multiple, namely all possible and reasonable meta-analyses at once.\nHereby, multiverse meta-analyses provide a research integration like umbrella reviews yet additionally investigate the influence flexibility in data analysis could have on the resulting summary effect size. Importantly, in contrast to umbrella reviews, a multiverse analysis also quantitatively summarizes the results and includes not yet conducted meta-analyses. During the talk I will give a more detailed insight into this potent method, and run through the multiverse of meta-analyses on the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression as an empirical example.\n Watch Presentation\n\n\n\nISOQOL 2022\nModeling general populations‚Äô reference data for PROMIS item banks (Physical Functioning, Upper Extremities, and Pain interference) in multiple countries using quantile regression January 1, 2022\nAims: The use of PROs in research and clinical practice requires availability of appropriate and relevant comparison data. We aim to model age, and sex-specific reference values for the PROMIS Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), and Pain Interference (PI) scales in populations age 50 and older in Germany, the UK, and the US.\nMethods: We collected PROMIS PF, UE, and PI data via telephone interviews from the general population in Germany (N = 921), the UK (N = 905), and the US (N = 900). We investigated differential item functioning (DIF) between countries using iterative hybrid ordinal logistic regression. To account for the measurement error of latent estimates and to obtain a continuous distribution of the latent variable, we imputed 25 data sets with plausible values. Each latent estimate was replaced by a random value drawn from the individual latent variable posterior distribution approximated by a normal distribution. We then utilized quantile regressions to model the 1st, 5th, 10th‚Äì90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles and their respective standard errors in each dataset based on different combinations of predictors (age, sex, country). According to Rubin‚Äôs rules, the estimated percentiles and corresponding standard errors were pooled across the imputed datasets to provide the respective reference values.\nResults: Three items from the PROMIS PF scale showed negligible DIF by country, indicating that all scales are valid for inter-country comparisons. Median regressions revealed significant effects of age (PF: bùúè=.50= -0.33; PI: bùúè=50= 0.08), sex (PF: bùúè=50= -3.22; PI: bùúè=50= 1.62) and country, indicating that stratification of reference data is warranted. The PF and UE scales showed considerable ceiling effects in all countries aged 50-69. For PI, this applied to all ages.\nConclusions: This paper illustrates a novel approach to model reference values for PROMIS measures based on individual patients‚Äô characteristics. Substantial differences in the PROMIS scores between sex, age, and countries highlight the importance of such patient-specific reference values, enabling clinicians to utilize personalized reference values. Due to the use of plausible value imputation, the obtained population reference values can be compared to data collected with other PROMIS short forms or computer-adaptive tests.\n Conference Program"

    "text": "2021\n\nPHO 2021\nDifferential item functioning of PROMIS physical functioning ceiling items across Argentina, Germany and the US November 23, 2021\nObjective: We investigate the validity of comparisons across general populations from Argentina, Germany, and the US by evaluating differential item functioning (DIF) for the PROMIS physical function (PROMIS-PF 2.0) ceiling items that were implemented to measure high physical ability. DIF is investigated as it could introduce biases to inter-country comparisons by potentially leading to systematically different physical function scores.

    "text": "Objective: We investigate the validity of comparisons across general populations from Argentina, Germany, and the US by evaluating differential item functioning (DIF) for the PROMIS physical function (PROMIS-PF 2.0) ceiling items that were implemented to measure high physical ability.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: At several stages in any meta-analysis, researchers must decide between multiple equally defensible choices (e.g., different study inclusion criteria, different ways of dealing with low-quality studies, different choices of methods, etc.). These different analytical decisions frequently result in various meta-analyses with overlapping research questions reaching different conclusions‚Äîresulting in ambiguous recommendations for clinicians, researchers, and funding agencies.\nMethods: In a multiverse meta-analysis, researchers identify all these possible stages for analytical decisions, determine alternative analysis steps at each stage, and implement them simultaneously. As a result, a multiverse meta-analysis reports the outcomes of all possible meta-analyses resulting from all of these possible combinations. Therefore, this method is a promising tool to help answer why some of these meta-analyses diverged, whether the meta-analytical method and exclusion criteria were decisive for these differences, or whether we would reach similar results with most analytical strategies.\nResults: We present the preliminary results of multiverse meta-analyses to evaluate the influence different analytical decisions might have had on two research questions, namely 1) the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression and 2) the efficacy of digital interventions for anxiety disorders.\nConclusion: We could identify several analytical decisions that consistently lead to inflated effect size estimates (e.g., the comparison with wait-list control groups, the inclusion of high risk of bias studies, and sometimes ignoring effect size dependency). However, we also identified many decisions that did not disproportionately influence the resulting summary effect size estimates, suggesting the overall robustness of meta-analytical findings on psychological treatments for depression and digital mental health research for anxiety.\n\n\nLink to Program"

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Over the last decade, several meta-analyses and meta-reviews synthesized the evidence on the efficacy of digital mental health interventions for anxiety disorders‚Äîunfortunately with diverging conclusions. This leaves clinicians, researchers, and funding agencies with inconsistent recommendations. Methods: To provide a birds-eye-perspective of the entire field we conducted an umbrella review and a multiverse meta-analysis. We investigated whether the meta-analytical method or the inclusion criteria were responsible for these differences, or whether most potential meta-analyses would reach similar conclusions. Results: Our umbrella review included six meta-analyses with 84 primary studies. The included meta-analyses differed substantially in their AMSTAR-2 ratings, indicating heterogeneous quality. Our multiverse meta-analysis produced 1193 meta-analyses resulting from all possible analytical decisions. We identified several analytical decisions that consistently led to inflated effect size estimates. Larger effect sizes were found for the comparisons with wait-list control groups than for the comparisons with active control groups (mean Hedges g = 0.58 95% CI [0.40, 0.76] vs g = 0.26 95% CI [0.20, 0.42]). Larger effect sizes were found for digital interventions combining smartphone with internet interventions compared to standalone smartphone or internet applications. Meta-analyses that focused exclusively on guided interventions produced twice the effect sizes than meta-analyses on unguided interventions (g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90] vs g = 0.30, 95% CI [0.13, 0.47]). Conclusion: We identified several analytical decisions that consistently led to inflated effect size estimates. However, we also found that most decisions did not disproportionately influence the resulting summary effect size estimates, which suggests that meta-analytical findings on digital interventions for anxiety are robust.\n\n\nLink to Program"

    "title": "Running Your First Multiverse Meta-Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When conducting a meta-analysis, researchers face dozens of decisions: Which studies to include? How to handle outliers? Which statistical model to use? Each choice seems reasonable, but different choices can lead to different conclusions.\nRather than making one set of arbitrary decisions, multiverse meta-analysis systematically explores how different reasonable analytical choices affect your conclusions. This approach transforms researcher degrees of freedom from a source of concern into a tool for understanding robustness.\nThis tutorial walks you through running your first multiverse meta-analysis using real data from the Metapsy database.\n\n\nBasic R knowledge is helpful, but I‚Äôll explain each step. You‚Äôll need:\n\nR (version 4.0 or higher)\nRStudio (recommended but not required)\nAbout 30 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to install metaMultiverse for running the multiverse analysis. We‚Äôll get the data directly from the Metapsy API (no package installation needed for that!).\n\n\n\n# Install devtools if you don't have it\nif (!require(\"devtools\")) install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n# Install metaMultiverse from GitHub\ndevtools::install_github(\"cyplessen/metaMultiverse\", \n                         force = TRUE, \n                         upgrade = \"never\")\n\n\n\n\n\n# You could also use remotes instead of devtools:\nif (!require(\"remotes\"))\n  install.packages(\"remotes\")\n\nremotes::install_github(\n  \"metapsy-project/metapsyTools\")\n\nNow load the packages we‚Äôll need:\n\nlibrary(metaMultiverse)\nlibrary(metapsyTools)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)     # for data manipulation\nlibrary(jsonlite)  # for reading API data\nlibrary(knitr)     # for formatted tables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetapsy maintains databases of psychotherapy trials across different mental health conditions. For this guide, you can either use their API to download data on psychotherapy for depression, I have already installed it so I do not abuse their service too much :)\nYou could also download their data as a .csv file and load it into R as below:\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv2(\"data-guide.csv\") \n\n# You can get the depression psychotherapy database via API like this:\n# The API requires 'shorthand' parameter and optional 'version' (defaults to 'latest')\n# api_url &lt;- \"http://api.metapsy.org/v1/get_data?shorthand=depression-psyctr&version=latest\"\n# api_response &lt;- fromJSON(api_url)\n# \n# # Extract the data\n# data &lt;- as.data.frame(api_response$data)\n# \n# # Take a look at what we have\nskimr::skim(data)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ndata\n\n\nNumber of rows\n900\n\n\nNumber of

We‚Äôll use the E/U/N framework (Del Giudice & Gangestad, 2021):\n\n\nNot all analytical decisions are created equal. The framework distinguishes three types:\nType E (Equivalent): Options are theoretically interchangeable for your research question.\n\nExample: Age groups (adults vs.¬†mixed) when studying a universal phenomenon\nIn multiverse: Creates variations within a single multiverse\nInterpretation: All options are included; adds ‚Äútotal‚Äù option combining all levels\n\nType U (Uncertain): Unclear which option is methodologically ‚Äúcorrect.‚Äù\n\nExample: Risk of bias thresholds‚Äîexclude only high-risk studies, or also ‚Äúsome concerns‚Äù?\nIn multiverse: Creates variations within a single multiverse\nInterpretation: Exploring sensitivity to debated methodological choices\n\nType N (Non-equivalent): Options address fundamentally different research questions.\n\nExample: Post-treatment vs.¬†follow-up outcomes represent different constructs\nIn multiverse: Creates separate multiverses analyzed independently\nInterpretation: These shouldn‚Äôt be combined; report separately\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs define some decisions for our depression intervention data:\n\nmultiverse_specs_example_1 &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  define_factors(\n    Age = \"age_group|U\",\n    Risk_of_Bias = list(\n      \"rob\",\n      decision = \"U\",\n      groups = list(\n        low_only = \"4\",\n        low_moderate = c(\"4\", \"3\"),\n        all_studies = c(\"4\", \"3\", \"2\", \"1\", \"0\")\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n\n[OK] Factor setup complete\n========================================================\n[*] Age (simple)\n   Column: age_group | Decision: U (Uncertain - will create multiverse options)\n   Levels: adul, old, olderold, yadul, adol&yadul, Not specified (+ all combined)\n\n[*] Risk_of_Bias (custom)\n   Column: rob | Decision: U (Uncertain - will create multiverse options)\n   Groups:\n     - low_only: 4\n     - low_moderate: 4, 3\n     - all_studies: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\n\n========================================================\nTotal: 2 factors (1 simple, 1 custom)\n\n# Display the factor setup as a formatted table\nkable(multiverse_specs_example_1$factors,\n      caption = \"Defined factors for multiverse analysis\")\n\n\nDefined factors for multiverse analysis\n\n\nlabel\ncolumn\ndecision\nwf_internal\ngrouping_type\n\n\n\n\nAge\nage_group\nU\nwf_1\nsimple\n\n\nRisk_of_Bias\nrob\nU\nwf_2\ncustom\n\n\n\n\n\nThe |E or |U tells the package whether this variable contains equivalent or uncertain studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we tell the package to create all possible combinations of our decisions, paired with different meta-analytic methods:\n\n# Create all combinations\nmultiverse_full_example_1 &lt;- multiverse_specs_example_1 %&gt;%\n  create_multiverse_specifications(\n    \n    # Try different statistical models\n    ma_methods = c(\"reml\", \"p-uniform\", \"waap\", \"rve\"),\n    \n    # How to handle multiple comparisons from same study\n    dependencies = c(\"select_max\", \"aggregate\", \"modeled\")\n  )\n\n\n[*] Multiverse Specifications Created\n========================================================\n  126 specifications\n  1 multiverse(s)\n  2 factors included\n  4 methods x 3 dependencies\n\n# Display the number of specifications created\nspecs_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = \"Total specifications created\",\n  Value = nrow(multiverse_full_example_1$specifications)\n)\nkable(specs_summary,\n      caption = \"Multiverse specification summary\")\n\n\nMultiverse specification summary\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nTotal specifications created\n126\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates dozens or hundreds of unique meta-analyses, each with different combinations of inclusion criteria and statistical methods.\n\n\n\n\nNow we run all these analyses. This might take a few minutes:\n\n# Run all analyses\nresults_example_1 &lt;- run_multiverse_analysis(multiverse_full_example_1)\n\n\n# Create a formatted summary of the multiverse analysis results\nn_failed &lt;- results_example_1$n_attempted - results_example_1$n_successful\n\nanalysis_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Total specifications\", \"Successful\", \"Failed\", \"Success rate\"),\n  Value = c(\n    as.character(results_example_1$n_attempted),\n    as.character(results_example_1$n_successful),\n    as.character(n_failed),\n    paste0(round(100 * results_example_1$n_successful / results_example_1$n_attempted, 1), \"%\")\n  )\n)\n\nkable(analysis_summary,\n      caption = \"Multiverse analysis execution summary\")\n\n\nMultiverse analysis execution summary\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nTotal specifications\n126\n\n\nSuccessful\n90\n\n\nFailed\n36\n\n\nSuccess rate\n71.4%\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package runs each meta-analysis and stores the results: effect size, confidence interval, p-value, and heterogeneity statistics.\n\n\n\n\nThe real power comes from visualization. A specification curve shows how effect sizes vary across all your analytical choices:\n\n# Plot specification curve\nplot_spec_curve(results_example_1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows:\n\nTop panel: Effect size for each analysis (sorted by magnitude)\nBottom panels: Which analytical choices were used for each analysis\n\nYou can immediately see:\n\nHow much do results vary?\nAre some choices driving the results?\nIs the effect robust across specifications?\n\nAnother useful visualization is the Vibration of Effects (VoE) plot:\n\n# Explore relationship between effect size and significance\nplot_voe(results_example_1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the relationship between effect sizes and p-values across your multiverse.\n\n\n\nIn this example, we‚Äôll use Type N decisions to create separate multiverses based on study quality. This is appropriate when different quality standards represent fundamentally different research questions.\nResearch question: How does the effectiveness of digital interventions vary when we apply different study quality criteria?\nSince these represent different questions about evidence quality (not just sensitivity analyses), we use decision = \"N\":\n\nmultiverse_specs_example_2 &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  define_factors(\n    Age = \"age_group|U\",\n\n    # Type N: Each quality threshold is a separate research question\n    Risk_of_Bias = list(\n      \"rob\",\n      decision = \"N\",  # Non-equivalent: creates separate multiverses\n      groups = list(\n        low_only = \"4\",                          # Only highest quality\n        low_moderate = c(\"4\", \"3\"),              # High + moderate quality\n        all_studies = c(\"4\", \"3\", \"2\", \"1\", \"0\") # All studies\n      )\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  create_multiverse_specifications(\n    ma_methods = c(\"reml\", \"p-uniform\", \"waap\", \"rve\"),\n    dependencies = c(\"select_max\", \"aggregate\", \"modeled\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  run_multiverse_analysis()\n\nWhat‚Äôs different with Type N?\n\nCreates 3 separate multiverses (one per quality threshold)\nNo ‚Äútotal_‚Äù option added (they shouldn‚Äôt be combined)\nEach multiverse is analyzed independently\nResults should be reported separately, not pooled\n\n\n# Display the multiverse structure as a formatted table\nmultiverse_structure &lt;- as.data.frame(table(multiverse_specs_example_2$results$multiverse_id))\nkable(multiverse_structure,\n      col.names = c(\"Multiverse ID\", \"Number of Specifications\"),\n      caption = \"Separate multiverses by study quality threshold\")\n\n\nSeparate multiverses by study quality threshold\n\n\nMultiverse ID\nNumber of Specifications\n\n\n\n\nall_studies\n30\n\n\nlow_moderate\n29\n\n\nlow_only\n28\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows we have three independent multiverses, each answering a distinct question about intervention effectiveness under different quality standards.\n\n\n\n# Plot specification curve showing all three multiverses\nplot_spec_curve(multiverse_specs_example_2)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting N-type multiverses:\nThe specification curve now shows results colored by multiverse_id. You can see:\n\nWhether effect sizes are consistent across quality thresholds\nIf stricter quality criteria lead to larger/smaller effects\nThe range of uncertainty within each quality tier\n\n\n# VoE plot across multiverses\nplot_voe(multiverse_specs_example_2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nHow much do results vary? If all analyses point in the same direction with similar magnitudes, your conclusion is robust. If effect sizes range from positive to negative, your conclusion depends heavily on analytical choices.\nWhich choices matter most? Look at the bottom panels of the specification curve. Do certain inclusion criteria consistently produce larger or smaller effects?\nStatistical significance: Do most analyses show significant effects, or does significance depend on which models you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiverse meta-analysis doesn‚Äôt give you ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù‚Äîit gives you transparency about how confident you should be in your answer. If your conclusion holds across most reasonable analytical choices, you can be more confident. If it‚Äôs sensitive to specific decisions, that‚Äôs important to report.\nThis approach moves us from ‚Äúthe effect size is X‚Äù to ‚Äúacross plausible specifications, effect sizes range from Y to Z, with most falling around X.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial covered the practical workflow for multiverse meta-analysis. The metaMultiverse package can do much more:\n\nInclude bias-adjustment methods (PET-PEESE, selection models)\nExplore moderator effects across specifications\nExport results for custom visualizations\nUse the interactive Shiny app for exploration\nAdvanced custom factor groupings\nBayesian meta-analytic methods\n\n\n\nFor quick start: See vignette(\"getting-started\", package = \"metaMultiverse\") for a streamlined introduction focusing on essential workflow steps.\nFor comprehensive theoretical background: See vignette(\"multiverse-theory-practice\", package = \"metaMultiverse\") for in-depth coverage of:\n\nThe E/U/N decision framework (Del Giudice & Gangestad, 2021)\nAdvanced interpretation and reporting guidelines\nTroubleshooting and edge cases\nComplete methodological reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage:\n\nmetaMultiverse GitHub\nPackage Documentation\n\nData Source:\n\nMetapsy Database\nMetapsy Documentation\n\nKey References:\n\nDel Giudice, M., & Gangestad, S.

As a methodologist and advocate for scientific rigor, I‚Äôve spent my career examining how evidence is constructed, interpreted, and applied‚Äîoften finding that our most cherished research practices contain hidden fragilities. What fascinates me isn‚Äôt just the production of knowledge but the messier question of how that knowledge translates into real improvements in human welfare.\nMy work spans two complementary domains. As a psychometrician, I investigate how we can best measure important domains such as physical functioning, pain interference, and depression from the patient perspective. For instance, I explored how we can effectively use questionnaires on the same topic across different cultures, examining measurement invariance and differential item functioning in PROMIS¬Æ measures across English, German, and Spanish versions. My research has addressed fundamental challenges in patient-reported outcomes, including overcoming floor and ceiling effects in knee arthroplasty measurement and developing reference values that make scores meaningful for clinical interpretation.\nSimultaneously, in research synthesis, I‚Äôve pioneered the application of multiverse meta-analyses to psychological interventions, running thousands of analytical variations on psychotherapy and digital interventions for depression and anxiety. This approach reveals how seemingly innocent analytical choices can dramatically alter conclusions about treatment efficacy, challenging us to develop more robust methods for evidence synthesis.\nThrough my publications, I‚Äôve worked to develop both theoretical frameworks and practical tools that serve a single purpose: ensuring that when we claim to help people through psychological or medical interventions, we‚Äôre actually doing so. This methodological pluralism reflects my conviction that advancing scientific rigor requires multiple approaches to measurement and evidence synthesis."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction In the past four decades, over 700 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 80 meta-analyses have examined the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression. Overwhelming evidence suggests that all types of psychological treatments are effective. Yet, many aspects are still unexplored. Meta-analysts could perform hundreds of potential meta-analyses with the current literature, and a comprehensive bird‚Äôs-eye view of all published studies is missing. This protocol outlines how a multiverse meta-analysis can evaluate the entire body of the literature on psychological treatments of depression in a single analysis. Thereby, gaps of evidence and areas of robustness are highlighted.\nMethods and analysis We will conduct systematic literature searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up until 1 January 2021. We will include all RCTs comparing a psychological treatment with a control condition. We will include studies published in English, German, Spanish or Dutch, and exclude trials on maintenance and relapse prevention as well as dissertations. Two independent researchers will check all records. All self-reported and clinician-rated instruments measuring depression are included. We will extract information on recruitment settings, target groups, age groups, comorbidity, intervention formats, psychotherapy types, number of sessions, control conditions and country. Two independent researchers will assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. As part of the multiverse meta-analysis, unweighted, fixed effect and random effects models will be calculated.\nEthics and dissemination As we will not collect any primary data, an ethical approval of this protocol is not required. We will publish the results in a peer-review journal and present them at international conferences. We will follow open science practices and provide our code and data.\n\n\nFull Text Link"

    "text": "Conference Abstract\nAims: The use of PROs in research and clinical practice requires availability of appropriate and relevant comparison data. We aim to model age, and sex-specific reference values for the PROMIS Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), and Pain Interference (PI) scales in populations age 50 and older in Germany, the UK, and the US.\nMethods: We collected PROMIS PF, UE, and PI data via telephone interviews from the general population in Germany (N = 921), the UK (N = 905), and the US (N = 900). We investigated differential item functioning (DIF) between countries using iterative hybrid ordinal logistic regression. To account for the measurement error of latent estimates and to obtain a continuous distribution of the latent variable, we imputed 25 data sets with plausible values. Each latent estimate was replaced by a random value drawn from the individual latent variable posterior distribution approximated by a normal distribution. We then utilized quantile regressions to model the 1st, 5th, 10th‚Äì90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles and their respective standard errors in each dataset based on different combinations of predictors (age, sex, country). According to Rubin‚Äôs rules, the estimated percentiles and corresponding standard errors were pooled across the imputed datasets to provide the respective reference values.\nResults: Three items from the PROMIS PF scale showed negligible DIF by country, indicating that all scales are valid for inter-country comparisons. Median regressions revealed significant effects of age (PF: bùúè=.50= -0.33; PI: bùúè=50= 0.08), sex (PF: bùúè=50= -3.22; PI: bùúè=50= 1.62) and country, indicating that stratification of reference data is warranted. The PF and UE scales showed considerable ceiling effects in all countries aged 50-69. For PI, this applied to all ages.\nConclusions: This paper illustrates a novel approach to model reference values for PROMIS measures based on individual patients‚Äô characteristics. Substantial differences in the PROMIS scores between sex, age, and countries highlight the importance of such patient-specific reference values, enabling clinicians to utilize personalized reference values. Due to the use of plausible value imputation, the obtained population reference values can be compared to data collected with other PROMIS short forms or computer-adaptive tests.\nLink to Program"

    "text": "Abstract\nEven though conventional meta-analyses provide an overview of the published literature on a given research question, they do not consider different paths that could have been taken in selecting or analyzing the data. Most importantly, multiple meta-analyses with overlapping research questions can reach different conclusions due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, or data analytical decisions. It is therefore crucial to evaluate the influence such choices might have on the result of each meta-analysis. Was the meta-analytical method and exclusion criteria decisive, or is the same result reached via multiple analytical strategies? What if a meta-analysts would have decided to go a different path‚Äîwould the same outcome occur? Ensuring that the conclusions of a meta-analysis are not disproportionately influenced by data analytical decisions, a multiverse meta-analysis can provide the entire picture and underpin the robustness of the findings‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîby conducting multiple, namely all possible and reasonable meta-analyses at once. Hereby, multiverse meta-analyses provide a research integration like umbrella reviews yet additionally investigate the influence flexibility in data analysis could have on the resulting summary effect size. Importantly, in contrast to umbrella reviews, a multiverse analysis also quantitatively summarizes the results and includes not yet conducted meta-analyses. During the talk I will give a more detailed insight into this potent method, and run through the multiverse of meta-analyses on the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression as an empirical example.\n\n\nLink to Video of Presentation"

Sie funktionieren am besten wenn: jemand Sie durch das Programm begleitet, Sie erwachsen sind, Sie eine diagnostizierte Depression haben, und das Programm mit keiner Behandlung verglichen wird. Die Effekte halten mindestens 24 Wochen an.\n\n\nPlessen, C. Y., Karyotaki, E., Miguel, C., Ciharova, M., & Cuijpers, P. (2023). Exploring the efficacy of psychotherapies for depression: a multiverse meta-analysis. BMJ Mental Health, 26(1), e300626.  üìÑ   üìñ\n\n\n\nüá¨üáßPlain English\n\nWhat did we do? We analyzed 92 studies comparing psychotherapy to no treatment for depression. Instead of making one analysis, we ran 4,281 different analyses using different reasonable choices researchers could make.\nWhy does it matter? Research results can change depending on how researchers analyze their data. We wanted to see if psychotherapy for depression works no matter how you analyze the data, or if results depend on researcher choices.\nWhat did we find? Good news: Psychotherapy works for depression across all 4,281 analyses. However, the size of the effect varied quite a bit (from small to large) depending on analysis choices. Studies with weaker methods, waitlist control groups, and no correction for publication bias showed bigger effects. This means we need to be transparent about our choices when doing research.\n\n\n\nüá©üá™Einfache Sprache\n\nWas haben wir gemacht? Wir haben 92 Studien analysiert, die Psychotherapie mit keiner Behandlung f√ºr Depression verglichen. Anstatt eine Analyse zu machen, haben wir 4.281 verschiedene Analysen mit unterschiedlichen vern√ºnftigen Entscheidungen durchgef√ºhrt, die Forscher treffen k√∂nnten.\nWarum ist das wichtig? Forschungsergebnisse k√∂nnen sich √§ndern, je nachdem wie Forscher ihre Daten analysieren. Wir wollten sehen, ob Psychotherapie f√ºr Depression funktioniert, egal wie man die Daten analysiert, oder ob Ergebnisse von Forscherentscheidungen abh√§ngen.\nWas haben wir herausgefunden? Gute Nachricht: Psychotherapie funktioniert f√ºr Depression √ºber alle 4.281 Analysen hinweg. Aber die Gr√∂√üe des Effekts variierte ziemlich stark (von klein bis gro√ü), abh√§ngig von Analyseentscheidungen. Studien mit schw√§cheren Methoden, Wartelisten-Kontrollgruppen und ohne Korrektur f√ºr Publikationsbias zeigten gr√∂√üere Effekte. Das bedeutet, wir m√ºssen transparent √ºber unsere Entscheidungen sein, wenn wir forschen.\n\n\nPlessen, C. Y., Hartmann, C., Heng, M., Liegl, G., Fischer, F., & Rose, M. (2023). How are age, gender, and country differences associated with PROMIS physical function, upper extremity, and pain interference scores? Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 482(2), 244-256.  üìÑ   üìñ\n\n\n\nüá¨üáßPlain English\n\nWhat did we do? We created reference values for health questionnaires about physical function and pain. We studied how age, gender, and country (USA, UK, Germany) affect people‚Äôs scores, using data from over 15,000 people.\nWhy does it matter? When a patient gets a score on a health questionnaire, doctors need to know: ‚ÄúIs this normal for someone their age and gender?‚Äù Reference values help doctors interpret scores and make better treatment decisions.\nWhat did we find? Physical function decreases with age, especially for upper body activities. Women report slightly more difficulty with physical tasks than men. Country differences were small. We built a website tool where doctors can enter a patient‚Äôs age, gender, and country to see how their score compares to similar people. This helps make scores meaningful and actionable.\n\n\n\nüá©üá™Einfache Sprache\n\nWas haben wir gemacht? Wir haben Referenzwerte f√ºr Gesundheitsfrageb√∂gen √ºber k√∂rperliche Funktion und Schmerzen erstellt. Wir haben untersucht, wie Alter, Geschlecht und Land (USA, UK, Deutschland) die Punktzahlen von Menschen beeinflussen, mit Daten von √ºber 15.000 Menschen.\nWarum ist das wichtig? Wenn ein Patient eine Punktzahl auf einem Gesundheitsfragebogen bekommt, m√ºssen √Ñrzte wissen: ‚ÄúIst das normal f√ºr jemanden in diesem Alter und Geschlecht?‚Äù Referenzwerte helfen √Ñrzten, Punktzahlen zu interpretieren und bessere Behandlungsentscheidungen zu treffen.\nWas haben wir herausgefunden? Die k√∂rperliche Funktion nimmt mit dem Alter ab, besonders f√ºr Oberk√∂rperaktivit√§ten. Frauen berichten etwas mehr Schwierigkeiten mit k√∂rperlichen Aufgaben als M√§nner. L√§nderunterschiede waren klein. Wir haben ein Website-Tool gebaut, wo √Ñrzte Alter, Geschlecht und Land eines Patienten eingeben k√∂nnen, um zu sehen, wie ihre Punktzahl im Vergleich zu √§hnlichen Menschen ist. Dies hilft, Punktzahlen bedeutungsvoll und umsetzbar zu machen.\n\n\nPlessen, C. Y., Karyotaki, E., & Cuijpers, P. (2022). Exploring the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression: a multiverse meta-analysis protocol. BMJ Open, 12(1), e050197.  üìÑ  üìñ\n\n\n\nüá¨üáßPlain English\n\nWhat did we do? We published our plan (called a protocol) for how we would study psychotherapy for depression using multiverse analysis. We described our methods before seeing the results, to be transparent.\nWhy does it matter? When researchers decide how to analyze data after seeing results, they might (consciously or not) choose methods that make results look better. By publishing our plan first, we commit to our methods and make our research more trustworthy.\nWhat did we find? This is a protocol paper - it describes what we planned to do. The actual results were published in 2023 (see that paper above). Publishing protocols like this is good research practice and helps prevent bias in science.\n\n\n\nüá©üá™Einfache Sprache\n\nWas haben wir gemacht? Wir haben unseren Plan (genannt Protokoll) ver√∂ffentlicht, wie wir Psychotherapie f√ºr Depression mit Multiversum-Analyse studieren w√ºrden. Wir haben unsere Methoden beschrieben, bevor wir die Ergebnisse gesehen haben, um transparent zu sein.\nWarum ist das wichtig? Wenn Forscher entscheiden, wie sie Daten analysieren, nachdem sie Ergebnisse gesehen haben, k√∂nnten sie (bewusst oder unbewusst) Methoden w√§hlen, die Ergebnisse besser aussehen lassen. Indem wir unseren Plan zuerst ver√∂ffentlichen, verpflichten wir uns zu unseren Methoden und machen unsere Forschung vertrauensw√ºrdiger.\nWas haben wir herausgefunden? Dies ist ein Protokoll-Papier - es beschreibt, was wir geplant haben zu tun. Die tats√§chlichen Ergebnisse wurden 2023 ver√∂ffentlicht (siehe das Papier oben). Protokolle wie dieses zu ver√∂ffentlichen ist gute Forschungspraxis und hilft, Verzerrungen in der Wissenschaft zu verhindern.\n\n\nPlessen, C. Y., Franken, F., Kathofer, M., Kotlyar, E., Maierwieser, R. J., Mayer, A., Rattner, K., Schmid, R. R., Sobisch, M., Ster, C., Wolfmayer, C., & Tran, U. S. (2020). Humor-styles and personality traits: An updated meta-analysis. Personality and Individual Differences, 154, 109676.  üìÑ  üìñ\n\n\n\nüá¨üáßPlain English\n\nWhat did we do? We combined results from many studies (a meta-analysis) to see how different humor styles relate to personality traits. We looked at four humor styles: affiliative (bringing people together), self-enhancing (staying positive), aggressive (putting others down), and self-defeating (making fun of yourself).\nWhy does it matter? Humor is an important part of social life and mental health. Understanding how humor relates to personality helps us understand individual differences and potentially identify people who might benefit from interventions.\nWhat did we find? Positive humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing) were linked to extraversion and openness. Negative humor styles (aggressive, self-defeating) were linked to neuroticism. Self-defeating humor was negatively related to conscientiousness. These patterns help us understand how humor fits into broader personality structures.\n\n\n\nüá©üá™Einfache Sprache\n\nWas haben wir gemacht? Wir haben Ergebnisse aus vielen Studien (eine Meta-Analyse) kombiniert, um zu sehen, wie verschiedene Humor-Stile mit Pers√∂nlichkeitsmerkmalen zusammenh√§ngen. Wir haben vier Humor-Stile betrachtet: affiliativ (Menschen zusammenbringen), selbst-verst√§rkend (positiv bleiben), aggressiv (andere herabsetzen) und selbst-erniedrigend (sich selbst lustig machen).\nWarum ist das wichtig? Humor ist ein wichtiger Teil des sozialen Lebens und der psychischen Gesundheit. Zu verstehen, wie Humor mit Pers√∂nlichkeit zusammenh√§ngt, hilft uns, individuelle Unterschiede zu verstehen und m√∂glicherweise Menschen zu identifizieren, die von Interventionen profitieren k√∂nnten.\nWas haben wir herausgefunden? Positive Humor-Stile (affiliativ, selbst-verst√§rkend) waren mit Extraversion und Offenheit verbunden. Negative Humor-Stile (aggressiv, selbst-erniedrigend) waren mit Neurotizismus verbunden. Selbst-erniedrigender Humor war negativ mit Gewissenhaftigkeit verbunden. Diese Muster helfen uns zu verstehen, wie Humor in breitere Pers√∂nlichkeitsstrukturen passt.\n\n\nPlessen, C. Y., Boeckle, M., Liegl, G., Leitner, A., Schneider, A., Preining, B., & Pieh, C. (2016). Bedarfsanalyse f√ºr ambulante Psychotherapie in √ñsterreich [Supply and demand analysis for psychotherapy in Austria]. Psychologische Medizin, 3, 4-9. üìÑ üìñ\n\n\n\nüá¨üáßPlain English\n\nWhat did we do? We analyzed the supply and demand for outpatient psychotherapy in Austria. We looked at how many therapists are available, how many people need therapy, and whether supply meets demand across different regions of Austria.\nWhy does it matter? Many people with mental health problems need psychotherapy, but if there aren‚Äôt enough therapists or they‚Äôre in the wrong places, people can‚Äôt get help. Understanding gaps in care helps policymakers allocate resources better.\nWhat did we find? There were significant gaps between supply and demand for psychotherapy in Austria. Some regions had much better access than others. The findings highlighted the need for better planning of psychotherapy services to ensure everyone who needs help can access it.\n\n\n\nüá©üá™Einfache Sprache\n\nWas haben wir gemacht? Wir haben Angebot und Nachfrage f√ºr ambulante Psychotherapie in √ñsterreich analysiert. Wir haben untersucht, wie viele Therapeuten verf√ºgbar sind, wie viele Menschen Therapie brauchen, und ob Angebot und Nachfrage in verschiedenen Regionen √ñsterreichs √ºbereinstimmen.\nWarum ist das wichtig? Viele Menschen mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen brauchen Psychotherapie, aber wenn es nicht genug Therapeuten gibt oder sie an den falschen Orten sind, k√∂nnen Menschen keine Hilfe bekommen. Versorgungsl√ºcken zu verstehen hilft politischen Entscheidungstr√§gern, Ressourcen besser zu verteilen.\nWas haben wir herausgefunden? Es gab signifikante L√ºcken zwischen Angebot und Nachfrage f√ºr Psychotherapie in √ñsterreich. Manche Regionen hatten viel besseren Zugang als andere. Die Ergebnisse zeigten die Notwendigkeit besserer Planung von Psychotherapie-Diensten, um sicherzustellen, dass jeder, der Hilfe braucht, diese auch bekommen kann."

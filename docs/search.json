As there are many defensible choices a researcher could make in conducting a meta-analysis, I am interested in the overall influence such arbitrary decisions might have on entire research fields. In particular, I am using this method to investigate the robustness of psychotherapy research and digital mental-health research for depression and anxiety.\nI also aim to bring a common practice from differential psychology to health-related quality of life research: timely and patient-specific norm data. I believe it is important that patients are compared to an up-to-date and patient-specific reference group. To provide such data, I use plausible value imputation and quantile regression and program shiny apps to help visualize a patients health-related quality of life relative to others from the same country, with a similar age, and sex.\nWe are also working on multiverse differential item functioning analyses, to understand the influence arbitrary data-analytic decisions might have when we investigate measurement invariance."

    "text": "Conference Abstract\nAims: The use of PROs in research and clinical practice requires availability of appropriate and relevant comparison data. We aim to model age, and sex-specific reference values for the PROMIS Physical Function (PF), Upper Extremity (UE), and Pain Interference (PI) scales in populations age 50 and older in Germany, the UK, and the US.\nMethods: We collected PROMIS PF, UE, and PI data via telephone interviews from the general population in Germany (N = 921), the UK (N = 905), and the US (N = 900). We investigated differential item functioning (DIF) between countries using iterative hybrid ordinal logistic regression. To account for the measurement error of latent estimates and to obtain a continuous distribution of the latent variable, we imputed 25 data sets with plausible values. Each latent estimate was replaced by a random value drawn from the individual latent variable posterior distribution approximated by a normal distribution. We then utilized quantile regressions to model the 1st, 5th, 10th–90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles and their respective standard errors in each dataset based on different combinations of predictors (age, sex, country). According to Rubin’s rules, the estimated percentiles and corresponding standard errors were pooled across the imputed datasets to provide the respective reference values.\nResults: Three items from the PROMIS PF scale showed negligible DIF by country, indicating that all scales are valid for inter-country comparisons. Median regressions revealed significant effects of age (PF: b𝜏=.50= -0.33; PI: b𝜏=50= 0.08), sex (PF: b𝜏=50= -3.22; PI: b𝜏=50= 1.62) and country, indicating that stratification of reference data is warranted. The PF and UE scales showed considerable ceiling effects in all countries aged 50-69. For PI, this applied to all ages.\nConclusions: This paper illustrates a novel approach to model reference values for PROMIS measures based on individual patients’ characteristics. Substantial differences in the PROMIS scores between sex, age, and countries highlight the importance of such patient-specific reference values, enabling clinicians to utilize personalized reference values. Due to the use of plausible value imputation, the obtained population reference values can be compared to data collected with other PROMIS short forms or computer-adaptive tests.\nLink to Program"

    "text": "Objective: We investigate the validity of comparisons across general populations from Argentina, Germany, and the US by evaluating differential item functioning (DIF) for the PROMIS physical function (PROMIS-PF 2.0) ceiling items that were implemented to measure high physical ability. DIF is investigated as it could introduce biases to inter-country comparisons by potentially leading to systematically different physical function scores. If DIF is detected, individuals with the same ‘true’ underlying physical ability would score systematically different due specific cultural contexts or language differences.\nMethods: General population samples completed the 35 ceiling items of the PROMIS PF 2.0. DIF was assessed with hybrid logistic ordinal regression models and Nagelkerkes’ pseudo R2-change of > 0.02 as the critical cutoff value indicating the presence of DIF. The impact of DIF on item scores and the T-scores was additionally examined by inspecting both the item characteristic curves (ICCs) and test characteristic curves (TCCs).\nResults: Overall, 3601 persons participated—1001 from Argentina (mean age of 35.6 years, ranging from 18 to 69 years; 51% were female), 1000 from Germany (mean age of 44.9 years, ranging from 18 to 69; 52% were female), and 1600 from the US (mean age of 44.3 years, ranging from 18 to 88; 58% were female). For the comparison between Germany and the USA, 2 out of 35 items were flagged for DIF. For the comparison between Argentina and the US, 4 items were flagged and for the comparison between German and Argentinian items, 5 out of 35 items were flagged. Most DIF items had R2 values just above the critical value of 0.02 and all showed uniform DIF. The ICCs and TCCs showed that the magnitude and impact of DIF on the item and T-scores were negligible.\nConclusions: Our study supports the universal applicability of PROMIS across general populations from Argentina, Germany, and the US. Comparisons across persons from the general population are valid, when applying the PROMIS-PF 2.0 ceiling items."

    "text": "PhD Researcher at the Department of Clinical, Neuro- and Developmental Psychology, VU Amsterdam\nI worked as a PhD researcher in clinical psychology at VU Amsterdam from 2020-2024 (have a look at my final PhD thesis here). It included five publications and focused on research synthesis of psychological interventions for mental health.\nI was always fascinated by a dangerous situation: most scientists consider meta-analyses to be the best evidence, meta-analyses are used as the final word in any evidence based discussion—they contain the “true truths”. To investigate how robust the evidence they contain are, meaning how much their results depend on the data-analytic strategy, I conducted over 10,000 meta-analyses on similar topics (effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression, effectiveness of digital interventions for depression/anxiety) to give a robust Birds-Eye-perspective of these fields. I found that there are many arbitrary decisions, meaning equally defensible decisions (include only studies of high quality, exclude studies with low quality, or include all studies—all of these practices are common), that indeed make a difference. And there are various ways to increase or decrease the final result—the “true truth”—that could easily be exploited to confirm your beloved believes. And if something scares me in life, it´s that there is only one bias, the ultimate bias, confirmation bias, and even if we fight it as hard as we can to not be fooled by it, we can hardly ever pull it off.\n\nGuided self-help interventions for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis: preliminary evidence that self-help interventions work.\nExploring the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression: a multiverse meta-analysis protocol: Very good idea to write a protocol and statistical analysis plan beforehand, however, a registered report would have been better.\nExploring the efficacy of psychotherapies for depression: a multiverse meta-analysis: so many researcher degrees of freedom\nDigital mental health interventions for the treatment of depression: A multiverse meta-analysis\nDigital mental health interventions for anxiety: An Umbrella Review and a multiverse meta-analysis: Similar to the combination of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, an umbrella review would be the perfect place to also include a multiverse meta-analysis. I strongly believe they should go hand in hand. Unfortunately the data is “too old” and I don’t have it in me to extract more data and redo all the analyses, rewrite the script.\n\nI worked closely with Clara Miguel to transform the most important databases containing data from all available randomised controlled trials on Depression and PTSD into the mammoth project Metapsy spearheaded by Matthias Harrer. Here is a blogpost by Matthias introducing meta-analytic research domains, a brilliant way to avoid research waste, make science and meta-analyses more transparent and open.\nDuring that time, I was lucky enough to co-author many important papers, and feel very fortunate that I was part of the most interesting email chains I could have dreamed of as they contained dozens of back and forth between professors arguing issues I am fascinated by:\n\nPsychological treatment of depression with other comorbid mental disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis\nCognitive behavior therapy vs. control conditions, other psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and combined treatment for depression: a comprehensive meta-analysis including 409 trials with 52,702 patients\nPsychological treatment of depression: A systematic overview of a ‘Meta-Analytic Research Domain’\nAbsolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies for eight mental disorders: a systematic review and meta‐analysis\nSelf-reported vs clinician-rated measures in psychotherapy for depression\nSupersizing Meta-Analysis of Psychological Interventions: Features and Findings of the “Metapsy” Meta-Analytic Research Domain\nCognitive behavior therapy for mental disorders in adults: A uniform series of meta-analyses\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\nMeta-Analysis seminar\n\n\n\n\nPresentations\n\nPlessen, C.Y (2023).

Meta-analyses are often viewed as the gold standard in evidence-based practices, yet their outcomes can vary widely depending on analytical choices. To explore this, I conducted over 10,000 meta-analyses on psychotherapy and digital interventions for depression and anxiety, uncovering how researcher degrees of freedom can influence results. This work underscored the importance of transparent methodologies to mitigate biases and strengthen scientific reliability.\nCollaborating with the Metapsy Project, I contributed to transforming vast datasets into actionable insights for mental health research. The project’s innovative approach to meta-analytic research domains aimed to reduce research waste and promote transparency, values that remain central to my work."

    "text": "Researcher at Charité Center for Patient-Centered Outcomes Research\nOur current medical system is neither evidence-based nor patient-centered, which enrages me. To change this, we need to focus on the needs of patients, measure how they feel, progress, and regress. We can accomplish this by routinley integrating patient-reported outcomes that capture health-related quality of life. These self-reported measurment instruments are essential for transforming medicine from an eminence-based practice—where treatments are primarily driven by expert opinion—to a truly evidence-based approach that centers on patient well-being. I feel so strongly about this because evidence shows that many standard procedures, like some orthopedic surgeries, may not provide meaningful benefits to patients 1, 2. Which again, enrages me.\nFor healthcare to be genuinely patient-centered, we must go beyond merely treating symptoms, such as knee pain. It’s crucial to monitor each patient’s holistic experience, including daily functioning, mental health, quality of life, and social well-being, to ensure that interventions are truly beneficial and aligned with individual needs. This is why I investigated how to best measure these patient centered outcomes and worked from 2020-2024 at perfectly named the Charité Center for Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, where we focused on patient-reported outcomes: to advocate for a healthcare system that prioritizes patients, not just diseases.\nAs part of the Oxford-Berlin Partnership, I co-authored three papers and got familiar with the many researcher degrees of freedom that are part of the research process. For instance I realized that there a myriad of decision you could make on how you set a cutoff for saying an item of an questionaire has accepteble or inacceptible properties to be included. There are many different cutoffs that could be used to answer this question. This led to another research project.\n\nItem response theory assumptions were adequately met by the Oxford hip and knee scores showed that IRT assumptions hold for widely used orthopedic measures, setting a foundation for their valid use in clinical assessments.\nOvercoming floor and ceiling effects in knee arthroplasty outcome measurement tackled a prevalent issue in patient outcome measurement by addressing the limitations of ceiling and floor effects, which can obscure true patient experiences and outcomes in clinical trials.\nMy favorite, Item response theory may account for unequal item weighting and individual-level measurement error in trials that use PROMs: a psychometric sensitivity analysis of the TOPKAT trial explored alternative data analysis approaches. This work aligns with my belief that science benefits from investigating multiple plausible analyses, ultimately leading to more robust, evidence-based conclusions.\n\nMy work, partially funded by the AO Foundation, focused on optimizing physical functioning assessments for orthopedic patients by refining item banks and providing relevant demographic insights. In one project, I developed a shiny web application that enables clinicians to access reference values tailored to patients’ age, gender, and country, helping to interpret PROMIS® Physical Function and Pain Interference scores more accurately. This application was built on our publication, How Are Age, Gender, and Country Differences Associated With PROMIS Physical Function, Upper Extremity, and Pain Interference Scores?, which underscored significant demographic effects on these health measures, promoting more precise patient-centered care. The second project explored differential item functioning across languages—English, German, and Spanish—within the PROMIS Physical Function item bank, ensuring that items were equitable and not biased by language or cultural differences.\nThis work is currently available as a preprint, Differential Item Functioning between English, German, and Spanish PROMIS® Physical Function Ceiling Items, and has implications for the fair use of PROMIS measures in multilingual contexts, supporting more reliable cross-cultural assessments in orthopedic settings. I first presented these preliminary results as a poster at the PROMIS® Health Organization (PHO) 2021 conference. Together, these projects contribute to making patient-reported outcomes more robust, accessible, and relevant for diverse orthopedic patient populations.\nAs part of a project on self-management interventions for lower chronic back pain, I conducted a meta-analysis, where we analyzed their effects on pain and quality of life in individuals with chronic pain. This work contributed to the publication The effect of self‐management techniques on relevant outcomes in chronic low back pain: A systematic review and meta‐analysis which provides a comprehensive overview of how self-management can impact chronic pain outcomes, guiding evidence-based approaches for clinicians and patients alike. Based on these findings, we developed a questionnaire for measuring pain interference on a daily basis, which results were reported at the German College of Psychosomatic Medicine (DKPM) Development of an adaptive Instrument to measure momentary pain catastrophizing\nI regularly taught three courses for medical students as part of the Charité’s Modellstudiengang Medizin program, which integrates interactive learning modules to prepare students for practical, patient-centered care. The first course focused on nonverbal communication, training students to understand and interpret body language as a vital aspect of patient interaction. In “Evidence Based Medicine, Where is the proof?”, students learned to evaluate medical evidence critically, helping them make informed, evidence-based decisions in their future practice. Finally, ”Kommunikation, Interaktion, Teamwork” taught essential skills in patient communication, effective teamwork, and collaboration, preparing students for the realities of interdisciplinary healthcare settings. These courses emphasized the practical and human-centered aspects of medical training, equipping students with tools for compassionate and effective patient care.\nI contributed to WerteRadar, an interdisciplinary initiative combining IT, medical science, and media science to support patients in making informed decisions about sharing their data for scientific purposes. My role included organizing stakeholder workshops with patients to gather insights on their values and concerns, providing medical expertise to research partners, and managing various project aspects. I led literature and scoping reviews to map current knowledge and best practices around patient data sharing. This work aimed to create tools and frameworks that empower patients to reflect critically on data contribution, balancing scientific advancement with individual autonomy and privacy.\nI was a member of the SPOKES Think Tank, where we explored innovative ways to conduct and improve scientific research. As part of the Doing Science Differently podcast, I produced and moderated an episode with Noémie Aubert Bonn, focusing on assessing research practices. Additionally, I co-produced three episodes addressing critical topics like power abuse and mental health challenges in academia, as well as broader issues impacting the research community. These discussions aimed to foster transparency, inclusivity, and a healthier academic culture, aligning with the think tank’s mission to drive positive change in scientific practices.\nDuring that time, I completed a two-year structured program that enhances research skills in patient-centered clinical research and connects early-career scientists across German-speaking countries (Qualifizierungsprogramm klinische Forschung) of the German College of Psychosomatic Medicine (DKPM),. This certification program provided both practical and method-focused training to foster advanced research competencies."

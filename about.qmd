# Current Work

Currently, a central method I use and try to advance is multiverse meta-analysis. As there are many defensible choices a researcher could make in conducting a meta-analysis, I am interested in the overall influence such arbitrary decisions might have on the overall robustness of findings. I am using this method to investigate the robustness of psychotherapy research for depression and digital mental-health research for depression and anxiety.

I also aim to bring a common practice from differential psychology to health-related quality of life research: up-to-date and patient specific norm data. I believe it is important that patients are compared to a patient-specific reference group. To provide such data, I use plausible value imputation and quantile regression. 

We are also working on multiverse differential item functioning analyses, to understand the influence arbitrary data-analytical decisions might have in understanding whether single items might measure different constructs in different populations.

I'm starting a new position as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Graz](https://psychologie.uni-graz.at/en/) in Austria.

After researching psychometric methods and patient-reported outcomes at Charité and research synthesis methods and multiverse meta-analyses at VU Amsterdam, I'll now be diving deeper into personalization of psychotherapy and gender-sensitive psychotherapy at Graz.

## Research Focus

The work continues examining how analytical choices shape conclusions about treatment effectiveness, but with a stronger focus on individual differences. Questions like: Do treatments work differently for different people? Can we identify patterns that help match patients to interventions? How do gender and other characteristics moderate treatment effects?

This fits naturally with multiverse meta-analysis approaches—both are about understanding when and for whom our conclusions actually hold. My previous work examined analytical variability at the study level ([psychotherapy effectiveness](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjment-2022-300626), [digital interventions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.10.018)). Now extending this to variability at the individual level.

I'll keep sharing code and tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyplessen) and posting updates here. If you're working on personalization, gender-sensitive interventions, or meta-science questions, let's talk.

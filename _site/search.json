    "text": "Current Work\nCurrently, a central method I use and try to advance is multiverse meta-analysis. As there are many defensible choices a researcher could make in conducting a meta-analysis, I am interested in the overall influence such arbitrary decisions might have on the overall robustness of findings. I am using this method to investigate the robustness of psychotherapy research for depression and digital mental-health research for depression and anxiety.\nI also aim to bring a common practice from differential psychology to health-related quality of life research: up-to-date and patient specific norm data. I believe it is important that patients are compared to a patient-specific reference group."
